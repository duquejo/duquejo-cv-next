## Introduction

Some time ago, based on a couple of ideas with my brother and in an act of wanting to create and leave memories for the future, with the motivation of my wife, I was encouraged to study music production. That period was during the **COVID-19 pandemic** and with a **Focusrite Scarlett 2i2** interface, a pair of cardioid microphones, my guitar and an **Alesis v49 MIDI controller** I started an experimental sound project that allowed me to play with different textures of sound, which undoubtedly were influenced by my tastes related to **Video Games**, **Vaporwave**, **Instrumental** music and sometimes even leading me to add a bit of chaos through distortion and fuzz, details that still catch my attention to this day.

## My first cover: Something About Us

So, starting that stage and with all the enthusiasm to be able to generate a sound product without any kind of commitment or expectation, I wanted to make a cover. I had a great song in mind, _Something about us_, by **Daft Punk**. I still remember when just by adding the main melody, motifs for the bass line, two/three-voice choirs emerged and I challenged myself to sing the lead vocal.

This was the product, a detail that made me feel proud of what I had achieved with my recent production course and with the help of my wife, who designed a beautiful cover art and video, we added the cherry on top that allowed me to fill myself with courage to publish it on YouTube and on a few other social networks.

Clearly, the views didn't take off much and it was terribly demonetized due to Copyright, _thanks YouTube_, however, I keep that memory with happiness, which reminds me of those days.

> If by chance you took the opportunity to watch the video, you'll notice that at the end I decided to change the dynamics of the song. Inspired by the harmony of **Electric Light Orchestra**, _Mr. Blue Sky_, I added a large ensemble that left my production teacher quite surprised, but to his surprise, he liked it quite a bit. A curious detail that to this day motivates me to leave that personal touch in every product I carry out.

## Exploring 8-bit sounds

Later, motivated by the idea of exploring **8-bit** sounds, I decided together with my brother and my wife, to make a composition inspired by those **SNES** titles, an idea that later grew into a mini project that I'll delve into in another post:

## A tribute to The Legend of Zelda

Hey, yes, I also love the _Legend of Zelda_ franchise, _as well as Final Fantasy_. In a moment of great inspiration and with a lot of enthusiasm to showcase my skills with a beautiful **Kalimba** that my wife gave me, I made this cover of the relaxing song **"Healing song"**, which, if you know the games, you'll surely love the 3D render made to measure that takes you to the Kokiri Forest.

## Collaboration: Fantasmas

And last, _but not least_, I really highlight this wonderful project I did with **Laura**, a friend who besides being an excellent software developer, is a magnificent singer who contributed her talent and experience to make a cover of an adapted traditional choral song called **"Fantasmas"**. A song where we played with stereo voices, traditional approach and a beautiful product, very rooted in my culture.

## Final reflections

Later on, I'll comment on the mini project that allowed me to explore based on a base theme, a series of compositions that to this day, make me feel very proud of those days when I focused on making music in a more professional way and which I still hope to integrate into some programming projects I have pending.

Thanks for making it this far!, remember that my social networks are available for any questions or collaboration.
