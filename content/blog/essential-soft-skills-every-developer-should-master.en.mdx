## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of software development, technical skills are undoubtedly crucial. However, mastering soft skills is equally important for a successful career.

> This is an article that I originally wrote when I was working for **Ceiba Software**, back to 2025. An amazing company where I learned a lot about teamwork and collaboration.

Now, without further ado... here are five essential soft skills that I follow like a karma, that every developer should cultivate.

1. **Communication**: Effectively sharing your results and requirements is key, especially in remote or digital workspaces. As developers, we spend a lot of time reading and writing. Strong writing skills help us communicate with teammates, keep ideas organized, and ensure everyone gets the full picture of the software requirements. Clear communication also reduces misunderstandings and speeds up project delivery by aligning expectations early on.

2. **Adaptability**: You must choose the right words for the right audience. Whether you're going to use highly technical language or just keep it simple, make sure your message is clear. Your team usually doesn't need every tiny detail, so keep it concise and let your ideas shine. Talk tech with developers, strategy with the business team, and uptime with operations or the support team. Being adaptable also means being open to feedback and adjusting your communication style as the project or audience evolves.

3. **Collaboration**: Just writing good code isn't enough. Building strong relationships with your colleagues is essential. It's about trust, not just staying in your own bubble. Remember, big projects require strong teamwork to stay on track and avoid roadblocks. Be open to feedback and take it with humility and respect — it's how you get better at working together. Effective collaboration also involves knowing when to ask for help and when to offer support, facilitating a positive and productive team environment.

4. **Critical Thinking**: Don't just take the first solution you find. Explore different sources — whether it's a quick web search or specialized AI tools like _Miia, ChatGPT, Copilot, among others_ — and choose the approach that best fits your needs. While there are plenty of tools to make things easier, sticking to good software practices like **Clean Code**, **Clean Architecture**, and mastering fundamentals like the **S.O.L.I.D** principles and **OOP** will keep you on the right track. Critical thinking also means questioning assumptions and anticipating potential issues before they arise.

5. **Problem Solving**: When you run into an issue, ask yourself, _“What's changed?”_ and dive deep into the problem once you spot it. Not every solution is the same, so get comfortable with _monitoring, logging, debugging, and reading metrics_. These skills will help you identify the root cause faster. Additionally, documenting your problem-solving process can save time for you and your team during future troubleshooting.

### Bonus track!

That's because who doesn't love a bonus😉, seriously!

Nowadays, we often prioritize **work over personal life**. Maintaining a balance between the two is crucial for managing the weekly pace and avoiding burnout.

> There have been moments when I told myself, “Hey! You need to take a break!” Every pause helps keep ideas flowing and allows you to unwind.

Activities like **grabbing a coffee** or **having a quick chat** can help with that. Most development blocks happen because it's hard to overthink every possible scenario — especially when you're also dealing with personal concerns. So, **take it easy** 🍃, and the solution will likely come when you least expect it.
