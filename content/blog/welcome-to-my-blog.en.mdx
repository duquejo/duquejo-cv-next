## Introduction

Hey there!, It's challenging to anticipate the necessity of migrations, especially regarding technology stacks. After years of using **Vue.js** for my personal blog, I've decided to switch to **React** with **Next.js** for several reasons I'd like to share.

> **Vue.js** truly shines for its simplicity and ease of use in relatively simple applications. I appreciate how it handles reactivity and the component lifecycle (onMount, etc..), which I find more straightforward compared to the sometimes complex pain points of **React's** _useEffect_. I still use **Vue.js** in some personal projects.

Looking back on my past experiences, I decided to move away _(not too far)_ from **React** and take on many challenges with my trusty friend _(Vue.js)_ which provided me with great experiences. It even led me to consider using the **Quarkus** framework for mobile applications, which ultimately opened the door for me to explore **React Native** today.

However, as I started to build more complex applications, I found myself running into limitations that made development more challenging. The combination of **Next.js** and **React**, in contrast, proved to be an amazing solution for building scalable and performant web applications.

**React.js** is a powerful library I've been mastering over the years, _despite its learning curve_. By utilizing the **Next.js** framework, I definitely discovered a suite of features that significantly improved my toolset.

### Long story short

In conclusion, while **Vue.js** will always hold a special place in my heart, I'm so happy to carry on the journey of **React** and **Next.js** for my personal blog. I believe this migration will allow me to build more complex and scalable applications while also improving my development experience.

The migration has already given significant improvements to my website, including: **dynamic PDF** downloads using **Next.js** server actions, live **GitHub/Blog** contributions stats, using the API routes, and an **improved performance boost** that enhanced my **SEO and Core Web Vitals** scores.

### Next steps

- I'll be sharing more about my experiences with all the languages that I love using. In future blog posts, I'll add some tips and tricks I've learned along the way.
- I might also found a way to make it automatically, maybe using some AI tool, or maybe doing some mobile application for myself... _I'm still thinking about it!_.
